# GWT-GXT-Hibernate
Application realizing login / logout logic with GWT and Hibernate

This application is my solution of the test task to some firm. It is my first try in GXT (third in GWT).

Write GWT application. Use maven. First page provides the log in possibility. Page constitutes of head with logo and footer. At interface creation use UiBinder. Customer names and passwords are saved in a data base. After the application start, DB should contain some usernames, passwords, and user localized names. The passwords would be saved with using hash and salt. Interaction with DB should be via Hibernate. After login tha home page should be opened. In this page there should be greeting with user name. Greeting should depend on time. All messages would be localized. Use browser locale. Translate to Russian (Ukrainian) language. If there is no translation, use English.
